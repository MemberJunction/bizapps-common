# @mj-biz-apps/common-core-entities-server

## 5.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c33643: Decouple Person from MJ User (fixes #36): saving a Person no longer provisions, links, syncs, or deactivates MJ User accounts. `PersonEntityServer` is reduced to a deprecated compatibility shell (protected helpers retained for downstream subclasses); the `LinkedUserID` EntityField is marked Status='Deprecated' via migration; the People entity is declared an overlapping IS-A parent (`AllowMultipleSubtypes=1`) so platform layers (e.g., BCSaaS 'BC: People') can own the person-to-user binding as an IS-A subtype. The LinkedUserID column remains physically in place; data disposition is owned by the platform layer's migration. The custom Person form no longer renders LinkedUserID.
